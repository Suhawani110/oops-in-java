Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (fields) and code (methods). Java is a popular language that fully supports OOP principles.

This repository demonstrates practical examples of all key OOP concepts, from basic to advanced, to help learners understand and apply them effectively.

Core OOP Concepts

Class & Object

Classes define the blueprint of objects.

Objects are instances of classes.

Encapsulation

Wrapping data (variables) and methods together.

Use of private fields and public getters/setters.

Inheritance

Enables a class to inherit properties and methods of another class.

Promotes code reusability.

Polymorphism

Compile-time (Method Overloading) and Runtime (Method Overriding).

Allows objects to take multiple forms.

Abstraction

Hiding internal implementation and showing only functionality.

Achieved via abstract classes and interfaces.

Interface & Abstract Class

Interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must follow.

Abstract classes provide partial implementation and can include abstract methods.

Additional OOP Concepts

Constructors

Special methods to initialize objects.

Types: default, parameterized, copy constructors.

Static Members

static fields and methods belong to the class rather than objects.

Final Keyword

Final variables, methods, and classes to prevent modification, overriding, or inheritance.

Packages & Access Modifiers

Organize classes into packages.

Access levels: public, private, protected, default.

Nested & Inner Classes

Classes defined inside other classes (static or non-static).

Method Overloading vs Overriding

Overloading: same method name, different parameters (compile-time).

Overriding: subclass redefines parent method (runtime).

This & Super Keywords

this refers to current object.

super refers to parent class members.

Object Class & Its Methods

toString(), equals(), hashCode(), clone().

All Java classes inherit from Object.

Composition & Aggregation

Represent "has-a" relationships between classes.

Exception Handling (OOP Perspective)

Exceptions use inheritance and polymorphism (try-catch, custom exceptions).

Java 8+ OOP Features

Default and static methods in interfaces.

Lambda expressions for functional interfaces.
