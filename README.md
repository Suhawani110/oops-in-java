Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (fields) and code (methods). Java is a popular language that fully supports OOP principles.

This repository demonstrates practical examples of all key OOP concepts, from basic to advanced, to help learners understand and apply them effectively.

 Core OOP Concepts

1.Class & Object

  ->Classes define the blueprint of objects.

  ->Objects are instances of classes.

2.Encapsulation

  ->Wrapping data (variables) and methods together.

  ->Use of private fields and public getters/setters.

3.Inheritance

  ->Enables a class to inherit properties and methods of another class.

  ->Promotes code reusability.

4.Polymorphism

  ->Compile-time (Method Overloading) and Runtime (Method Overriding).

  ->Allows objects to take multiple forms.

5.Abstraction

  ->Hiding internal implementation and showing only functionality.

  ->Achieved via abstract classes and interfaces.

6.Interface & Abstract Class

  ->Interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must follow.

  ->Abstract classes provide partial implementation and can include abstract methods.

7.Constructors

  ->Special methods to initialize objects.

  ->Types: default, parameterized, copy constructors.

8.Static Members

  ->static fields and methods belong to the class rather than objects.

9.Final Keyword

  ->Final variables, methods, and classes to prevent modification, overriding, or inheritance.

10.Packages & Access Modifiers

  ->Organize classes into packages.

  ->Access levels: public, private, protected, default.

11.Nested & Inner Classes

  ->Classes defined inside other classes (static or non-static).

12.Method Overloading vs Overriding

  ->Overloading: same method name, different parameters (compile-time).

  ->Overriding: subclass redefines parent method (runtime).

13.This & Super Keywords

  ->this refers to current object.

  ->super refers to parent class members.

14.Object Class & Its Methods

  ->toString(), equals(), hashCode(), clone().

  ->All Java classes inherit from Object.

15.Composition & Aggregation

  ->Represent "has-a" relationships between classes.

16.Exception Handling (OOP Perspective)

  ->Exceptions use inheritance and polymorphism (try-catch, custom exceptions).

17.Java 8+ OOP Features

  ->Default and static methods in interfaces.

  ->Lambda expressions for functional interfaces.ns for functional interfaces.
